# 3D Printed Microscope

This repository contains everything required to build and operate a high resolution microscope following the OpenFlexure framework. See the gallery below to preview!

The repository also contains a sample analysis notebook to demonstrate the extensibility of the design. Provided with images of a blood sample using the microscope, the notebook performs edge detection for automatic identification of red blood cells, then calculates parameters such as cell density and average dimensions.
