# 3D Printed Microscope

This repository contains everything required to build and operate a high resolution microscope following the OpenFlexure framework. See the gallery below to preview!

The repository also contains a sample analysis notebook to demonstrate the extensibility of the design. Provided with images of a blood sample using the microscope, the notebook performs edge detection for automatic identification of red blood cells, then calculates parameters such as cell density and average dimensions.

### Specifications:

Magnification - (405 $\pm$ 45) x

Resolution - (0.52 $\pm$ 0.28) $\mu m$

Unit cost - £221.05 (of Mar. 24)

Calculated commercially produced unit cost - £166.57 (of Mar. 24)
